The following is a checklist of tasks to complete. You can check them off
as you complete them.

[x] Make clicking on the recordings not immediately play them, but instead simply load them in a paused state, ready for playback.
[x] Make a unified play/pause button that displays "play" if playback is halted and "pause" if it's currently running.
[x] Move the list of recordings into a separately scrollable pane, above the playback pianoroll canvas.
[ ] move the play and panic buttons to the bottom pane, together with the piano roll
[ ] make it so that the panic button doesn't take us out of the currently loaded recording. It should simply note-off all existing notes
[ ] allow dragging the piano roll left and right, thereby changing the current time
