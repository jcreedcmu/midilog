The following is a checklist of tasks to complete. You can check them off
as you complete them.

[ ] Make clicking on the recordings not immediately play them, but instead simply load them in a paused state, ready for playback.
[ ] Make a unified play/pause button that displays "play" if playback is halted and "pause" if it's currently running.
[ ] Move the list of recordings into a separately scrollable pane, above the playback pianoroll canvas.
