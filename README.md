# midilog

This is an attempt to make some very light-weight, convenient way of
recording and playing back midi from a keyboard.

- `midilog.js` is the oldest attempt, using some midi node module

- The stuff in `browser/` is an attempt to use the web midi api. I was
  thinking I might be able to deploy this on my phone, even. That way
  I might be able to throw some controls on the screen. They'd be
  easier to reach for given the way my office is laid out right now
  --- the computer is not right next to the keyboard.
